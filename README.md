# Coursera Machine Learning

This repository contains projects from the Machine Learning Course taught by Andrew Ng from Stanford and offered through Coursera in the Fall of 2013.

The course is an introduction to machine learning, data mining and statistical pattern recognition.

## Models and Algorithms Developed
* Linear regression to predict profits of a food truck and dam water flow.
* Logistic regression to predict university admission and microchip quality.
* Logistic regression and neural network to identify hand-written digits.
* Support Vector Machine for a spam classifier.
* K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis for image compression. 
* Anomaly detection to identify failing servers on a network.
* Collaborative filtering for a movie recommender system.
